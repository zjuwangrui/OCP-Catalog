# OCP Catalog

The **Open Commerce Protocol (OCP) Catalog** — the protocol specification, its
schema/client packages, the CLI, and minimal reference implementations.

An OCP Catalog Node exposes a small HTTP surface that lets AI agents discover,
query, and resolve commercial objects (products, offers, suppliers, …) across
independent catalogs, with a separate Registration layer for discovery and a
Handshake layer for how providers feed data into a catalog.

## What's in this repo

This repo holds three tiers, in increasing order of distance from the spec:

| Tier | What it is | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Protocol** | The specs and the schema/client packages that encode them | [`docs/specs/`](./docs/specs), [`packages/`](./packages) |
| **Skill & CLI** | Agent tooling that speaks the protocol — installable in one command | [`skills/`](./skills), [`packages/ocp-cli/`](./packages/ocp-cli), [`plugins/`](./plugins) |
| **Examples** | The smallest correct Catalog Node, in three languages | [`examples/`](./examples) |

Production applications are **not** here — see [Reference applications](#reference-applications).

The published protocol packages (npm, scope `@ocp-catalog`):
[`ocp-schema`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ocp-catalog/ocp-schema),
[`registration-schema`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ocp-catalog/registration-schema),
[`ocp-activity-schema`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ocp-catalog/ocp-activity-schema),
[`ocp-client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ocp-catalog/ocp-client),
[`shared`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ocp-catalog/shared),
[`webmcp-adapter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ocp-catalog/webmcp-adapter),
[`ocp-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ocp-catalog/ocp-cli).

## Install the agent skill

The skill teaches an agent the OCP workflow — discover a Registration node,
inspect a Catalog manifest, query with a declared query pack, resolve an entry —
and drives it through the `ocp` CLI. There are two ways to install it, from the
same source (`skills/ocp-catalog/`):

**One command, any agent:**

```bash
npx @ocp-catalog/skill                # auto-detect
npx @ocp-catalog/skill --agent claude # ~/.claude/skills
npx @ocp-catalog/skill --agent all    # Claude Code + Codex + .agents
npx @ocp-catalog/skill --scope project # ./.claude/skills in the current repo
npx @ocp-catalog/skill doctor         # where is it installed?
```

It refuses to overwrite a skill it didn't install unless you pass `--force`, and
`--dry-run` prints the plan without touching disk.

**As a Claude Code plugin:**

```
/plugin marketplace add Open-Commerce-Protocol/OCP-Catalog
/plugin install ocp-catalog@ocp-catalog
```

If you already use the CLI, `ocp skill install` does the same thing.

## Reference applications

The production-grade catalog nodes, provider apps, admin UIs, the MCP server,
the skill gateway, demos, and deploy tooling live in a separate repo:

**[Open-Commerce-Protocol/ocp-catalog-instances](https://github.com/Open-Commerce-Protocol/ocp-catalog-instances)**

It depends on the protocol packages above from npm.

> The full pre-split monorepo history (all applications) is preserved on the
> [`legacy-monorepo`](https://github.com/Open-Commerce-Protocol/OCP-Catalog/tree/legacy-monorepo)
> branch and the `pre-split-monorepo` tag.

## A minimal Catalog Node

A spec-valid Catalog Node answers five endpoints. See
[`examples/`](./examples) for complete implementations in TypeScript, Python, and Go.

| Method | Path | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/.well-known/ocp-catalog` | discovery |
| GET | `/ocp/manifest` | capabilities + query packs |
| GET | `/ocp/health` | liveness |
| POST | `/ocp/query` | search entries |
| POST | `/ocp/resolve` | resolve an entry into action bindings |

## Develop

```bash
bun install
bun run typecheck
bun test
bun run build          # build the packages + site
bun run site:dev       # run the protocol website
bun run skill:sync     # regenerate the skill copies after editing skills/
bun run skill:check    # fail if a generated skill copy has drifted
```

Requires Bun 1.3+. The minimal examples each have their own README under
[`examples/`](./examples).

`skills/ocp-catalog/` is the single source of truth for the skill. The npm
payload and the Claude Code plugin copy are both generated from it by
`scripts/sync-skill-copies.ts` — edit the source, then run `skill:sync`.
