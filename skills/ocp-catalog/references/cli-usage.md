# CLI Usage

Use the OCP CLI for protocol calls. The CLI returns structured JSON so agents can inspect command help and command results without parsing terminal prose.

## Help

Standalone skill bundle:

```bash
bun scripts/ocp-skill-runner.ts help
bun scripts/ocp-skill-runner.ts registration --help
bun scripts/ocp-skill-runner.ts catalog query --help
```

Installed CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @ocp-catalog/ocp-cli
ocp help
ocp registration --help
ocp catalog query --help
```

Top-level help explains the OCP workflow. Domain help explains a protocol stage. Command help explains one command's purpose, options, and examples.

## Registration Commands

Registration commands work with Catalog metadata and routing. They do not search products, services, jobs, or other commercial objects.

```bash
bun scripts/ocp-skill-runner.ts registration discover https://ocp.deeplumen.io/.well-known/ocp-registration
```

Reads the Registration discovery document and finds manifest, catalog search, and route resolution endpoints.

```bash
bun scripts/ocp-skill-runner.ts registration search --registration-url https://ocp.deeplumen.io/registry --query "commerce"
```

Searches for suitable Catalogs by metadata, domain, capability, health, trust, and routing hints. It does not return CatalogEntry product results.

```bash
bun scripts/ocp-skill-runner.ts registration resolve --registration-url https://ocp.deeplumen.io/registry --catalog-id cat_local_dev
```

Resolves a selected Catalog id into a route hint or routing details. This is different from `catalog resolve`, which resolves one object entry.

## Catalog Commands

Catalog commands operate on one selected Catalog. Inspect the manifest before query or resolve.

```bash
bun scripts/ocp-skill-runner.ts catalog inspect http://localhost:4000/ocp/manifest
```

Reads the Catalog manifest so the agent can see endpoints, supported query packs, filter fields, object types, resolve capability, and auth policy.

For a signed manifest or discovery document, verify before treating capabilities as trusted:

```bash
ocp catalog inspect https://catalog.example.com/ocp/manifest --verify
```

`--verify` checks the document signature and trust policy. Use `--jwks <catalog_id>=<file-or-url>` for explicit key material or let the CLI discover the signer keys when the document supplies the required route. Do not silently continue as if the document were trusted when verification returns `signature_invalid`, `key_not_found`, `alg_not_supported`, or another verification error. Trust degradation is only valid when the declared policy permits it.

Verify a returned attribution token before using it for settlement or policy decisions:

```bash
ocp attribution verify ./resolve.json --jwks cat_example=./jwks.json
```

A relay verifies the complete upstream chain before appending its own hop. Keep the verifier's ordered first-error outcome intact; do not replace `chain_broken`, `replayed_jti`, `duplicate_order`, or signature/key errors with a generic success/failure flag.

```bash
bun scripts/ocp-skill-runner.ts catalog query --query-url http://localhost:4000/ocp/query --query-pack ocp.query.keyword.v1 --query-mode keyword --query "running shoes"
```

Searches commercial objects in the selected Catalog. Use only a `query_pack` declared by the manifest. If the Catalog can choose a default pack, `--query-pack` may be omitted. Use `--query-mode keyword|filter|semantic|hybrid` when the agent needs to force a manifest-declared execution mode instead of letting the client infer one from query text and filters.

Add `--manifest <file-or-url>` when an agent is preparing a request and should receive local validation errors before the query is sent. With a manifest, the CLI rejects unsupported query packs and filters and can fill the selected query pack when it is omitted.

```bash
bun scripts/ocp-skill-runner.ts catalog query --manifest http://localhost:4000/ocp/manifest --query-url http://localhost:4000/ocp/query --filters "{\"category\":\"shoes\"}"
```

Filters must be a JSON object using only fields accepted by the selected Catalog.

```bash
bun scripts/ocp-skill-runner.ts catalog resolve --resolve-url http://localhost:4000/ocp/resolve --entry-id <entry_id>
```

Resolves one selected query result entry for details, freshness, policy context, visible attributes, or action bindings. Do not use resolve as a bulk search replacement.

## Provider Commands

Use provider commands only when the agent is acting for a provider that publishes objects into one Catalog.

```bash
bun scripts/ocp-skill-runner.ts provider register --register-url http://localhost:4000/ocp/providers/register --input ./provider-registration.json --save-api-key ./.provider-api-key
```

`provider register` validates a local `ProviderRegistration` JSON file and posts it to the Catalog. Accepted registrations can return `provider_api_key`; it is returned only once, so store it immediately and do not commit it. When `--save-api-key` is used, stdout redacts the key and reports the saved path.

```bash
bun scripts/ocp-skill-runner.ts provider sync --sync-url http://localhost:4000/ocp/objects/sync --input ./object-sync-request.json --api-key "$PROVIDER_API_KEY"
```

`provider sync` validates a local `ObjectSyncRequest` JSON file and sends it with `x-api-key`. Use the provider-scoped key returned by registration, not a key from another provider.

## Validation And Activity

```bash
bun scripts/ocp-skill-runner.ts validate manifest http://localhost:4000/ocp/manifest
bun scripts/ocp-skill-runner.ts validate query --manifest http://localhost:4000/ocp/manifest --query "running shoes" --filters "{\"category\":\"shoes\"}"
bun scripts/ocp-skill-runner.ts events tail --activity-url https://ocp.deeplumen.io
```

`validate manifest` checks a local or remote Catalog manifest against the schema. `validate query` checks an agent's proposed query against that manifest before sending it: unsupported `query_pack` values, unsupported `query_mode` values, unsupported filter fields, invalid pagination, and missing semantic query text return explicit correction details. `events tail` reads the redacted public Activity API projection, not raw audit payloads. Its attribution data is limited to a closed outcome and, when configured, a keyed `correlation_id_hash`; it must not expose raw `jti`, `agent_id`, `order_id`, `report_id`, or the raw attribution block.

Use `--api-key` when the target endpoint requires an API key. Use `--correlation-id` to link a command to server-side activity events. Do not put tracing or telemetry fields inside strict OCP request bodies.

## Skill Management

```bash
ocp setup --target auto
ocp skill install --target both
ocp skill update --target auto
ocp skill doctor --target both
```

The standalone runner does not require the full OCP Catalog repository. It uses a bundled CLI when the skill was exported with `bun run skill:ocp:export`; otherwise set `OCP_CLI_COMMAND`, set `OCP_CLI_BIN`, or install an `ocp` binary on PATH.
